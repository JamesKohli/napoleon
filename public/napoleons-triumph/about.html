<p>
<b>Napoleon's Triumph</b> is a two-player wargame recreating the Battle of Austerlitz,
fought on December 2, 1805. One player commands the French army under Napoleon Bonaparte,
while the other commands the Allied army of Austria and Russia.

<p>
The game features a unique hidden-unit system where players cannot see the composition
of enemy forces until combat reveals them. Corps organization, command limitations,
and the innovative approach-based combat system create a tense fog-of-war experience
that rewards careful planning and bold maneuver.

<p>
Victory can be achieved by breaking enemy morale through combat losses, or by
controlling key objectives on the battlefield.
