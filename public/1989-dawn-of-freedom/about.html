1989 is an exciting, fast paced game simulating the end of the Cold War in
1989. During this amazing year, a series of democratic revolutions ended the 40
year Soviet empire in Eastern Europe. 1989 simulates the political, social and
economic aspects of these revolutions using a card driven system similar to
Twilight Struggle.
