9.2 COUNTRY SCORING TERMS
</h2>
<p>
<b>Presence:</b> A player has Presence in a country if it controls at 
least one space in that country.
<p>
<b>Domination:</b> A player achieves Domination of a country if 
he controls more spaces in that country than his opponent and 
he controls more Battleground spaces in that country than his 
opponent. A player must control at least one non-Battleground 
and one Battleground space in a country in order to achieve 
Domination of that country.

<div class="box" style="background-color:#d4effc">
<h2>
6.2 SUPPORT CHECKS
</h2>

<p>
<b>PURPOSE:</b> To reduce opponent Support in a country, and 
possibly to add friendly support if the Support check is successful enough.

<p>
<b>PROCEDURE:</b> Each Strategy Card played for Support Checks 
gives two Support Checks to the Phasing Player, regardless of 
the card’s Operations value. The player must resolve the first 
Support Check before declaring the next target.

<p>
<b>REQUIREMENT:</b> To attempt a Support Check in a space, 
the space must have opponent SPs. 

<p>
<b>RESOLUTION:</b> Multiply the Stability Number of the target 
space by two (x2). Then roll a die, and add the Ops value of 
the card played to the die roll plus any DRMs as listed below. 
If the modified die roll is greater than the doubled Stability 
Number, the Support Check succeeds, and the phasing player 
removes opposing SPs equal to the difference from the target 
space. If there are insufficient opposing SPs to remove, add 
friendly SPs to make up the difference.

<p>
<b>DIE ROLL MODIFIERS:</b>
<ul>
<li>
+1 for each adjacent friendly controlled space
<li>
&minus;1 for each adjacent opponent controlled space

<h2>
6.3 TIANANMEN SQUARE ATTEMPT
</h2>

<p>
<b>PURPOSE:</b> To move a players Tiananmen Square marker to 
the next box on the track.

<p>
<b>PROCEDURE:</b> Roll a die and add the Operations value of the card to the total. Modify this total:
<ul>
<li>
+1 if the card played is the player’s own Event.
<li>
+1 if this is the second or subsequent attempt to advance to the box.
<li>
+1 if the <i>‘Li Peng’</i> Event is in play and the attempting player is the Communist.
</ul>

<p>
<b>SUCCESS:</b> If the total matches or exceeds the number required to advance to next box (printed in the box in the color 
of the appropriate player), the player moves his marker forward 
to the new box.

<h2>
POWER STRUGGLE SEQUENCE
</h2>

<p class="ind">
<b>1. Deal Cards:</b> The players are dealt cards from the Power 
Struggle deck based upon the number of spaces they control 
in the country.

<p class="ind">
<b>2. Raise the Stakes:</b> Players may choose to increase the rewards and
penalties of the Power Struggle by discarding 3 of their Power Struggle cards

<p class="ind">
<b>3. Play Cards:</b> Players play Power Struggle cards one at a time, 
until the winner of the Power Struggle is determined.

<p class="ind">
<b>4. Aftermath:</b> After the winner of the Power Struggle is 
decided, there are two die rolls. The first determines how 
much Support the loser must remove from the country, and 
the second determines how many Victory Points the winner 
receives (and, if the winner is the Democrat, whether or not 
the Communist is toppled from power).

<p class="ind">
<b>5. Scoring:</b> Finally, the country is scored according to the rules 
in section 9.1, with the VP marker moving accordingly. 

</ol>

<p>
Note: all steps of a Power Struggle must be completed before 
checking the VP marker for auto-victory.

<h2>

<p class="ind">
+2 modifier to both rolls if a Rally in the Square was used to win the Power Struggle. 

<p class="ind">
+1 modifier to both rolls if either player <b>Raised the Stakes</b> in the Power
