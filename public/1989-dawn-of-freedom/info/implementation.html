<h1>
1989: Dawn of Freedom - Implementation and Card Notes</h1>

<hr>

<p>
This implementation and the materials on this site are the second edition rules.

<hr>
<h3>Cards which affect Operations Points</h3>
<p>Perestroika, The Sinatra Doctrine, and Prudence affect all actions taken by a player, regardless of whether it is that player's Action Round.</p>
<p>Prudence may be recovered from the discard pile (by events such as Honecker or The Reformer Rehabilitated) and played for a second time on the same turn. The effect cumulates.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Common European Home</h3>
<p>Common European Home is not an event in itself. If drawn during Kiss of Death it has no effect. It may not be played as an event from the discard pile.</p>
<p>During Stasi, if the Democrat player selects Common European Home for their next card, it must be played for operations. To use Common European Home to cancel a Communist Event, the Democrat player should announce the Communist event as the next card and then cancel it during their Action Round using Common European Home.</p>

<hr>
<h3>General Strike</h3>
<p>When under General Strike the Communist may play Scoring Cards for the Event. No die roll is made in this case.</p>

<hr>
<h3>
Events which affect the number of Power Struggle cards drawn (see <a href="/1989-dawn-of-freedom/info/rulebook.html#page10">8.1.2</a>)</h3>

<p>Roundtable Talks, Peasant Parties Revolt, and National Salvation Front affect the number of cards a player receives in a Power Struggle.
<p>Cards are drawn from the opponent hand before players have examined their hands. This is implemented automatically, with players immediately receiving their adjusted total number of cards.</p>

<hr>

<h3>The Crowd Turns Against Ceauceascu and The Tyrant is Gone (see <a href="/1989-dawn-of-freedom/info/rulebook.html#page9">7.6</a>)</h3>

<p>These Events represent the start of the Romanian Revolution and the attempt of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu to flee from the roof of the Central Committee building by helicopter.</p>
<p>When The Crowd Turns Against Ceausescu is played as an Event, it is shown in the Persistent Events box until the Romania Scoring card is played. It will then take effect after the Power Struggle cards are dealt but before the Power Struggle is resolved.</p>
<p>If The Tyrant is Gone is played as an Event before The Crowd Turns Against Ceausescu has taken effect during Romania Scoring, it is also shown in the Persistent Events box until the Romania Scoring card is played. After the Power Struggle is resolved, The Tyrant is Gone takes place immediately, before the next Action Round. If The Tyrant is Gone is played for the Event after The Crowd Turns Against Ceausescu has already occurred, i.e. the Romania Scoring card has been played and The Crowd Turns Against Ceausescu card’s effects applied, then The Tyrant is Gone takes effect immediately, like any other Event. If The Crowd Turns Against Ceausescu has not been played for the Event, The Tyrant is Gone goes in the discard pile.
<p>Before effects of The Tyrant is Gone have been implemented, the five events associated with the Ceausescus (Cult of Person­ality, Systematization, Ceausescu, Elena, and Massacre in Timisoara) may still take place.
