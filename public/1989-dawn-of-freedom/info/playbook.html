<p style="top:412.2pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">that the government enter talks </p>
<p style="top:425.9pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">with Solidarity to set conditions </p>
<p style="top:439.7pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">under which the martial-law-era ban could be lifted. The majority of </p>

<p style="top:591.0pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">of the 1980-81 movement. The talks ultimately resulted in Solidarity </p>
<p style="top:604.7pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">again being recognized as an independent trade union, and elections </p>
<p style="top:618.5pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">that would sweep Solidarity into power. For Jaruzelski, his dream of </p>
<p style="top:632.2pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">becoming the Polish Gorbachev was shattered. His willingness to risk </p>
<p style="top:646.0pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">his position to bring the party to the negotiating table with Solidarity </p>
<p style="top:659.7pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">would be quickly forgotten. In the minds of the Polish people he would </p>
<p style="top:673.5pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">forever remain the face of martial law.</p>
<p style="top:696.2pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt"><b>3. WALESA:</b> Lech Walesa was the most important opposition leader </p>
<p style="top:710.0pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">of 1989. An electrician by trade, he led the 1980 strikes at the Lenin </p>
<p style="top:723.7pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">Shipyard in Gdansk that began the Solidarity movement. Walesa had </p>
<p style="top:737.5pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">an unabashed personality, and that complete lack of self-conscious-</p>
<p style="top:751.2pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">ness gave him the ability to connect to the crowds. Though meagerly </p>
<p style="top:765.0pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">educated, he was an excellent debater. As a working man Walesa had </p>
<p style="top:778.7pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">contempt for the intellectual class, but he did work with them, and </p>
<p style="top:792.5pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">the partnership he was able to forge between the intellectuals and </p>
<p style="top:806.2pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">the workers was critical to ending communism in Poland. After 1989 </p>
<p style="top:820.0pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">Walesa became one of the loudest voices in favor of tough lustration </p>
<p style="top:833.7pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">laws and prosecutions of former Communists for crimes committed </p>
<p style="top:847.5pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">during the martial law period. This put Walesa in direct opposition to </p>
<p style="top:861.2pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">his friend and choice for prime minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who </p>
<p style="top:875.0pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">wanted &#x201c;a thick line&#x201d; between the democratic and Communist eras. </p>
<p style="top:888.7pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">Walesa defeated Mazowiecki in the Polish presidential election of 1990. </p>
<p style="top:902.5pt;left:45.0pt;font-size:11pt">Since that time Walesa&#x2019;s reputation has suffered, but he remains one </p>
