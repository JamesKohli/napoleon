# Tournaments

The automated tournaments are managed by the computer.

To play in one of these tournaments, simply register and wait.
Once enough players have joined, the tournaments will kick off automatically.
Make sure you've turned on notifications so you don't miss the start!

## Time Control

If you let a tournament game time out, you will not be allowed to join future tournaments!

## Format

### Rounds

Tournaments are round-robin, where each player meets every other player.
Everyone plays each side the same number of times.
There may be a few exceptions to these rules in 3+ player games at certain
player counts, but the system attempts to make the pairings as fair as possible.

Games in round two will start once at least one game in round one has finished, and so forth.

Everybody should have at least one game going at all times.

### Points

Victories are worth 2 points; ties and shared victories are worth 1 point.

score is used to break ties.

### Levels

Some tournaments may have multiple levels. If you win a tournament at one
level, you may play in the next level (once for each victory).

## Mini Cup

This is a small and fast tournament format for casual play.
The mini cup starts as soon as the required number of players have
entered.
You can play any number of mini cups.

The mini cup games use fast (3+ moves/day) time control.
