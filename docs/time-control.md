## Time Control

For everyone's enjoyment, please respect the pace requests!
If someone wants a fast game, don't join if you can only play one move per day.

Each player has a clock that ticks down while it's their turn.
When the clock runs out, they forfeit the game.
Each time a player takes a move, they get some time back on the clock, but there's a limit to how
much time you can accumulate.

<dl>
<dt> No time control
<dd> For friendly games without an enforced pace.
<dt> Live / Blitz (7+ moves per day)
<dd> 24h +4h/move up to 72h
<dt> Fast (3+ moves per day)
<dd> 72h +12h/move up to 120h
<dt> Slow (1+ move per day)
<dd> 72h +36h/move up to 240h

## Vacation

Every player has 5 vacation days per year.
If a player exceeds the time limit in a game, one vacation days is used up to add 24 hours on the clock to all their games.
When the vacation has run out, the games will be lost instead.

## Tournament Timeouts

Timing out in a tournament is very bad!


If you do this, you will not be allowed to join more tournaments.

Please be considerate and don't ruin the experience for everyone else!
